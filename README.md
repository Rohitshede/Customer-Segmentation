# Customer Segmentation

## Overview:
This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their behavior, demographics, and other relevant factors. By dividing customers into distinct segments, businesses can better understand their needs, preferences, and purchasing patterns, ultimately leading to more targeted marketing strategies and improved customer satisfaction.

## Methodology:
The segmentation process involves several steps:

- Data Collection: Gathered customer data from Kaggle.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis, including handling missing values, removing outliers, and standardizing variables.
- Feature Selection: Identified relevant features that could potentially differentiate customer segments, such as age, gender, purchase frequency, and average order value.
- Segmentation Algorithm: Utilized a K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers with similar characteristics into distinct segments.
